<p>Design an algorithm to encode an N-ary tree into a binary tree and decode the binary tree to get the original N-ary tree. An N-ary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more than N children. Similarly, a binary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more than 2 children. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that an N-ary tree can be encoded to a binary tree and this binary tree can be decoded to the original N-nary tree structure.</p>
<p>For example, you may encode the following&nbsp;<code>3-ary</code>&nbsp;tree to a binary tree in this way:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that the above is just an example which&nbsp;<em>might or might not</em>&nbsp;work. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>N</code>&nbsp;is in the range of&nbsp;<code>[1, 1000]</code></li>
<li>Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your encode and decode algorithms should be stateless.</li>
</ol>
